        <h4>What is Ear Candle therapy? </h4>
        <p>
            Ear candling is used primary for cleaning the ears and to promote a healthy atmosphere in the ears, sinus cavities and throat.
            The process can regulate pressure, assist with postnasal drip, sinusitis, catarrh, migraines,
            some forms of hearing loss, restoration of equilibrium, relieving tinnitus, vertigo and Meniere’s syndrome.

    <h4>How do they work? </h4>

    <p>
        The healing properties of the Hopi EarCandle have its foundation in two primary physical actions.
        Firstly, the slight underpressure (the chimney effect) inside the EarCandle and the vibration of the rising air column serve to gently massage the eardrum and promote secretion in the frontal and paranasal sinuses. This has an immediate subjective effect of regulating ear pressure. Users often describe a soothing, light sensation in the ear/head area. Secondly, the locally applied warmth stimulates vascularization, invigorates the immune system and reinforces the flow of lymph. At the same time, important acupuncture points and reflex zones are stimulated.
    </p>

    <p>
        The herbs in EarCandles have been used for centuries for their specific healing qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chamomile as an anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic sedative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sage as a carminative, astringent and circulatory stimulant relaxes peripheral blood vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
        St. John’s wort, as a restorative tonic for the nervous system and an analgesic.
    </p>
    <p>
        All these in combination are very effective in the treatment of head and ear related problems.
    </p>


    <h4> What can be treated by EarCandle therapy?</h4>
    <p>
        EarCandles are excellent in the treatment of nose and throat congestion, sinusitis, headaches,
        J.M.J pain, tinnitus, and otitis externa/tropical ear. Ideal relaxation treatment for stress or anxiety related symptoms. Softens earwax for easy removal.
    </p>

    <h4> What do I feel during or after treatment?</h4>
    <p>
        The client will undergo (either during or after a session) the sounds of the candle burning, a feeling of a lightening round the head, hearing sharper,
        a feeling of cleanliness and a sense of deep relaxation. Some benefits they could experience would be: better hearing, absence of noises in the ears,
        better lymphatic circulation, rid of excessive wax, pressure regulation, less aggravation in the sinus or ears, relief for Meniere’s Syndrome, relief for Vertigo.
    </p>

    <h4>  How is often the treatment given?</h4>

    <p>
        Each ear should be treated one after the other. We generally recommend one treatment daily for up to seven days in acute cases,
        one to two times a week for chronic indications, and one treatment regularly every three to four weeks for preventative or revitalising indication.
    </p>

    <h4> Precautions</h4>
    <p>
        No contraindications are known to date, but as a precautionary measure,
        don’t use EarCandles if the eardrum is perforated or if ventilating tubes (grommets) are present or if there is an acute ear infection.
    </p>

    <h4> Rest period</h4>
    <p>
        After both ears have been treated, a subsequent rest (10 ¨C15 minutes) is needed. This greatly assists the overall effect.
        The patient should remain lying down and can be comfortably covered with a blanket. Gently massage the ear, face and neck to enhance the effect.
    </p>

    <h4> Safe and Pure Issue</h4>
    <p>
        One thing ear candling is simple. There is no danger of injury in the hands of a skilled therapist.
