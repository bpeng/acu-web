        <h4> What is Cupping? </h4>
        <p>
            Cupping* is a traditional Chinese medicinal technique that Acuclic can offer to you. It can help with conditions such as acute pain through to respiratory problems.
        </p>

        <h4>How does Cupping Therapy work?</h4>
        <p>
            Cupping is an ancient Chinese therapy uses cups that are applied directly on the skin. The pressure in these cups is reduced by heat or by suction to draw and hold  the skin and the surface muscles inside of the cup. The cups can also be glided across the body in some circumstances pulling both the skin and the associated muscles along with it.
            These meridians begin at the fingertips, connect to the brain and then connect to the organ corresponding with that specific meridian.

    <h4>Does cupping utilise the traditional Acupuncture points?</h4>
    <p>
        Cupping, as with our other services, relates specifically to the appropriate acupuncture points but is also applied to other parts of the body that have been directly affected by pain. This is especially where the pain is deep and the tissues beneath the skin need to be extended.
        Cupping has traditionally been linked to back pain due to the ease of access to do this. It is frequently used in conjunction with Acupunture.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cupping specifically focuses on the meridians of the body. Mostly we focus on the back shu points, the bladder meridian and the dazhui.
    </p>

    <h4> How the Cupping process works</h4>

    <p>
        The glass cups have a valve that is attached to a small hand-operated pump.
        This allows the practitioner to suck the air out without having to rely on heat to depressurise the cup first.
        The valves gives us greater control over the amount of suction involved with the individual cups. The cups are lubricated with oil to allow the cups to move freely over the skin.
        This oil includes medicinal herbal extracts that are beneficial to the process.
        Please note that there may be some friction generated with the movement of the cups and this can generate some additional heat especially if a warming oil is used.
        After placement the cups are generally left in place for around 10-15 minutes.
        The skin noticeably reddens due to the congestion of blood flow beneath the cup.
        The cup is then removed by pressing on the skin on one side thereby allowing some outside air to enter to reduce the pressure.
        Some bruising can appear on the skin  especially where the rim of the cup was placed.

    <h4>  What are the benefits of Cupping?</h4>
    <p>  Cupping is recommended specifically for:</p>
    <div class="container art-listcontent">
        <ul>
            <li>Acute pain </li>
            <li>Gastrointestinal problems</li>
            <li>Lung diseases</li>
            <li>Chronic coughing</li>
            <li>Asthma.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
        Cupping can affect the body up to four inches into the tissues, causing the tissues to release toxins, especially activating the lymphatic system.
        It can also clear colon blockages and clear varicose veins, arteries and capillaries. It can also improve the appearance of varicose veins.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cupping removes blockages in the body and opens up he meridians so that qi can flow freely. On the other, it also helps to rejuvenate certain meridians and organs that are not functioning correctly.
        This activates the lymphatic system, promotes blood circulation and is particularly helpful for deep tissue repair.
    </p>

    <h4> Precautions during Pregnancy</h4>
    <p>
        During pregnancy cupping should not be performed on the abdomen or on the lower back .
    </p>

    <p>
        Cupping is always done on areas with plenty of flesh and is never performed on already inflamed skin or on any person that has an increased propensity to bruising.
