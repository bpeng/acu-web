    <p>
        <a href="/acupuncture"> Acupuncture </a> is an ancient system of healing that focuses on improving the overall well being of the patient.  A wide range of health problems are successfully treated by the insertion of fine needles into the body at specific points. Originating in China,
        these points have been mapped out over the past five thousand years and have more recently been confirmed through electromagnetic research.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/history-of-acupuncture">Traditional acupuncture</a> is based on ancient Chinese theories of the flow of Qi (energy), also referred to as Chi and Xue (blood) through distinct pathways or meridians that cover the body. Acupuncture needles are placed into acupoints that stimulate and enhances the free flow of Qi  regulating the harmony and general energetic balance of the entire body.
        This consequently both relieves pain and additional restores general health.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/moxibustion"> Moxibustion </a> works through a very similar method and relies on the same flows of energy through the body. It also focuses on the acupoints,
        as does <a href="/cupping"> cupping </a>.
