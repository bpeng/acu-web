        <span class="strong-colored">Acupressure</span> otherwise known as <span class="strong-colored">Chinese Massage</span> is an ancient procedure that involves applying pressure to specific meridian points on the body in order to relieve pain. The human body has fourteen “meridians” that transmit energy throughout the body.
        These meridians begin at the fingertips, connect to the brain and then connect to the organ corresponding with that specific meridian.

        According to Traditional Chinese Medicine there are over 800 vital energy points along these meridians that run from the head to the heels and especially along both sides of the spinal column. These meridians connect the inner and outer parts of the body. Every point has specific therapeutic effects to the appropriate organs. By firmly massaging these points, the associated body areas receives specifiically targetted therapeutic benefits. Western science has also revealed that many of these points are located directly at key crossways of the autonomic nervous system.

        The Acupuncturist utilises their fingers instead of needles to specifically activate key points on the skin surface and so stimulate the body’s own natural self-healing potential. The principle is fully centered around the same core principles of Acupunture but without the needles. When these key points are correctly pressed they release muscular tension both inwardly and outwardly specifically promoting the circulation of was blood to aid the healing process and get rid of poisonous toxins.
